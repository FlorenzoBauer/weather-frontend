## Abstract 
Weather Pal is a weather app, it can search a city and display the weather along with save locations, and see a random location! Future Iterations include mapbox to track distance and route to a location based on the weather.
I would love to implement a lightning feature to track nearby lightning strikes within a certain radius for safety for people that work outdoors and can be in danger during critical weather times. 

### Technologies

This weather application uses React, RESTful Api, Cypress E2E testing, Mapbox ( not fully implemented ). 

## Wins + Challenges:
Win: Using local storage for the first time. Being able to implement mapbox ( still needing to add routing functionality. Search for the map does work. )
Challenge: Implementing proper testing, Using the api key to accomplish these are difficult. Having troubles getting mock data to work! 

## Installation

Clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
npm install
npm start
